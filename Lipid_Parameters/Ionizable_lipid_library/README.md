## Naming scheme

The lipid names will have the form of ABCD, 4 captial letters, where the first two AB will represent the tails. 
The second two, CD, will represent the head and linker combinations. 
For the charged version of the lipid, the D spot will always be name P, for protonated. 

Generally the headgroup amine is named N1 and NP for the neutral and charged lipid, respectively.
