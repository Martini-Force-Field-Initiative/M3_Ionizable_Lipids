This is the equlibrated Lipid 10 (fully charge) particle including cholesterol and DSPC (no PEGylated lipids).
The RNA is dsRNA, 21nt poly A/U.


For the endosomal membrane composition, the model membrane we used is the A8 simplistic membrane from here (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7553384/)

The insane commando that has been used for the PMFs is : 
> insane.py -u POPC:24 -u PAPC:12 -u POPE:2 -u DIPE:6 -u DPSM:24 -u CHOL:31 -l POPC:14 -l PAPC:8 -l POPE:5 -l DIPE:16 -l DPSM:11 -l PAPS:25 -l SAP6:2 -l CHOL:28 -x 10 -y 10 -z 8 -o A8.gro -p topol.top


For the endosomal vesicle the tool TS2CG can be used, using the same scaling across the leaflets, but then of course relaxation of the vesicle with some channels is important. 

The ILs.itp contain parameters for MC3, Lipid 2 and Lipid 10, in both protonated and deprotonated form.
Generally the headgroup bead is N1/NP for neutral and charged, respectively.
