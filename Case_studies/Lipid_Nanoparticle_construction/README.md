### Lipid Nanoparticle Construction

Here in you find useful **_notebooks_** for constructing systems studied in the [original paper](https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-bf4n8).

#### Notebooks used for setting up an LNP with an inverse hexagonal core. 
Input files for the three LNPs simulated in the paper can also be found in this folder.

#### Notebooks for constructing a 'Bleb' like LNP.
Note that this is a showcase protocol optimized to run Molecular Dynamics on the resulting structure.
